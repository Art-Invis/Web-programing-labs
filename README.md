### Лабораторна робота №6 (Варіант 5)

#### Description

Start creating your React App with a simple Home page (see the link to wireframe above). Your e-commerce app subject is about your entities from previous (3-5) works.

### Variants
(Products that you are ‘selling’) are the same as for previous works. (See the description to 3rd work.)

### Requirements
- You have to use only React.js library for all of your mark-up. This means your `index.html` file shouldn’t be touched.
- Use the create-react-app tool for creating the base of your project. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Your Home page should follow the wireframe, i.e., all of the elements (header, navigation, footer, etc.) from wireframes must be presented on your website.
- **Design:** You have to use CSS styling or/and component libraries. Don't overthink it; use your imagination for UI, BUT the work with almost no styling is unacceptable.
- **Functionality:** For this work, nothing but the view-only part is required. Any interaction (links/buttons) is not necessary, but you will have to complete them in your next labs.
- **Code style:**
  - **Project structure:** Your UI elements should be logically separated into React components (one file for each component) - at least 5 component files are required. In other words, you can’t just put all your JSX into 1-2 files.
  - Use Functional components instead of Class components. [Functional Components](https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
