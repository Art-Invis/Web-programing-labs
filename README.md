### Лабораторна робота №9 (Варіант 5)
**Description:**  
You’re ready to put the final touches on your project by connecting your frontend pages to interact with your REST API server.

### Project Scope
- **Variants:** Use the same products you selected in previous works. (Refer to the description in the 3rd assignment).
- **Backend:** Use the same backend as your previous projects (works 3-5) or create a new one from scratch. The choice of tech stack is up to you.

### Requirements
#### 1. Maintain Previous Requirements
All previous requirements for your React.js assignments should still apply.
#### 2. Code Style
- **HTTP Requests:** Use the [axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios#installing) for any HTTP requests.
- **API Structure:** All API functions should be organized in a separate file (or folder, if preferred), similar to the Live Coding example in Lab 5 using the `fetch()` function.
#### 3. Functionality
- **Catalog Page:**  
  - Fetch all items from your backend with a **GET request** (use axios).
- **Search with Filters:**  
  - Implement search with filters using a **GET request**.
  - Pass filters as URL parameters.
  - Note: The search by text field can remain as is.
- **Loading State:**  
  - Display a **Spinner (Loader component)** to the user while waiting for a response from your GET request. You may refer to this [CSS loader example](https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/).
