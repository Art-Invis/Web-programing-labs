# React.js: Formik - Cart Page (Checkout & Success)

## Description
Finish your project by creating the last of three cart pages: **Checkout** and **Success** pages.  
As a bonus, you will learn a very handy and powerful form validation library - **Formik**.

### Variants
The products you are "selling" should be the same as in previous works. (See the description of the 3rd work for reference.)

## Requirements

### General
- All requirements from previous **React.js** works should be preserved.

### Functionality
- **Form:** Your form must include at least **5 fields**.
- **Validation Rules:** 
  - Every field should have a validation rule (e.g., max length, no special characters, only numbers).
  - The `required` option alone is **not enough**.
- **RegEx and Non-String Fields:** 
  - Include at least one field with a **RegEx** validation rule.
  - Include at least one field that does **not require a string value** (e.g., Phone Number).
- **Error Messages:**
  - Display all errors for all fields clearly.
  - Each error should explain the reason (e.g., "Email is incorrect", "First name is a required field").
  - Use a **separate React component** for error messages.
- **Form Submission:**
  - After a successful form submission, the user is redirected to the **Success Page**.

### Code Style
- Use **Formik** and **Yup** libraries or similar tools for:
  - Field validation.
  - Error messages.
  - Form submission handling.
